A review of the research on the sustainability of plant-based diets found that switching from the average Western diet to flexitarian eating, where meat is partially replaced by plant foods, could decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 7%. Eating more plant foods will also drive the demand for more land to be devoted to growing fruits and vegetables for humans instead of feed for livestock.

It’s not just the distance, it’s also the refrigeration along the way, and the energy that goes into packaging the food for the journey and storing it when it arrives. Produce which is in season tends to also be local food, which means much lower greenhouse gas emissions.
An easy way to save on fruits and vegetables is to buy what's in season when they are at their most plentiful. And there's a bonus that money can't buy when you follow this strategy: Fruits and vegetables always taste better when they are in season in your area and are harvested closer to the peak of freshness than those that spend a lot of time in shipping that might cover thousands of miles. 
A pleasant side-effect of eating what's in season is that you get a broader variety of foods in your diet. Those foods can broaden your palate, for one, but they may also expose you to dishes and ingredients you may not have otherwise explored, and while it doesn't go for every location, it can also help you eat a more well-rounded and balanced diet as well.

Owning a private vehicle, while very convenient, has many attached costs -- monthly payments, gasoline, oil changes and maintenance, parking, and insurance.

Car sharing takes more cars off the road. This might seem counterintuitive when companies place vehicles all over town, but it's true. People who frequently use car sharing tend to sell their own cars eventually and start using alternate modes of transportation, like biking and walking.
